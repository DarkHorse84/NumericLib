Built and tested using Eclipse CDT (2018-09),
using MinGW.org GCC-6.3.0-1, 
using armadillo (C++ library for linear algebra & scientific computing, version 9.200.6, 
I've had to include the source here because of pre-processor stuff I had to change to get it to build without LAPACK
 and other things as well as a workaround for some stuff missing in MinGW GCC version)
